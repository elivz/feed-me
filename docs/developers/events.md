# Events

Events can be used to extend the functionality of Feed Me.

## Feeds related events

### The `beforeSaveFeed` event

Plugins can get notified before a feed has been saved (through the control panel).

```php
use verbb\feedme\events\FeedEvent;
use verbb\feedme\services\Feeds;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Feeds::class, Feeds::EVENT_BEFORE_SAVE_FEED, function(FeedEvent $event) {

});
```

### The `beforeSaveFeed` event

Plugins can get notified after a feed has been saved (through the control panel).

```php
use verbb\feedme\events\FeedEvent;
use verbb\feedme\services\Feeds;

Event::on(Feeds::class, Feeds::EVENT_AFTER_SAVE_FEED, function(FeedEvent $event) {

});
```


## Data Fetching related events

Event::on(DataTypes::class, DataTypes::EVENT_BEFORE_FETCH_FEED, function(FeedDataEvent $event) {

});
```

### The `afterFetchFeed` event

Plugins can get notified after a feed's data has been fetched. Note the feed data hasn't been parsed at this point.

```php
use verbb\feedme\events\FeedDataEvent;

use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(DataTypes::class, DataTypes::EVENT_AFTER_FETCH_FEED, function(FeedDataEvent $event) {

});
```

### The `afterParseFeed` event

Plugins can get notified after a feed's data has been fetched and parsed into an array.

```php
use verbb\feedme\events\FeedDataEvent;
use verbb\feedme\services\DataTypes;

Event::on(DataTypes::class, DataTypes::EVENT_AFTER_PARSE_FEED, function(FeedDataEvent $event) {

});
```

Event::on(Process::class, Process::EVENT_BEFORE_PROCESS_FEED, function(FeedProcessEvent $event) {

});
```

### The `afterProcessFeed` event

Plugins can get notified after the feed processing has completed (all items are done).

```php

Event::on(Process::class, Process::EVENT_AFTER_PROCESS_FEED, function(FeedProcessEvent $event) {

```

### The `stepBeforeElementMatch` event

```

### The `stepBeforeElementSave` event

Event::on(Process::class, Process::EVENT_STEP_BEFORE_ELEMENT_SAVE, function(FeedProcessEvent $event) {

});
```

### The `stepAfterElementSave` event
